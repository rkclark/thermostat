# Makers Academy Week 5 Challenge: Thermostat

A project to build a javascript powered thermostat web application.

### Installation

- Clone this repo
- In the project root, open `SpecRunner.html` to see the tests
- To try the app, open `src/index.html`

### Specification:

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
- To know how to set your thermostat, you can enter your location to receive the current outside temperature
